# Python-Linear-Regression-to-Predict-Housing-Price-2D
# Housing Data of King County, USA contains eighteen variables including the price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, grade, floors, etc.
# The data sets were analyzed using Linear Regression model in Python with the aim of predicting the price of a house in King County USA.
# The target variable is the price, the grade variable shows the highest accuracy of 45% with the Price variable plotted in 2D
# Linear Regression model is then deployed to analyse the dataset in two Dimension and predict house price in King County USA.
# The Grade values as an independent variable is fitted into 0 to 8 on the x-axis, 
# while the Price dataset as a target variable is fitted into 0 to 16 on the y-axis.
# The dataset is splitted into (a) Test set: 1/3 of the data to test the model. (b) Train set: 2/3 of the data to train the model. 
# Linear regression model plot shows that the number of houses increases as the grade and prices increase, 
# The following evaluation parameters were produced from the plots: Coefficients: [204851.01871225], Intercept: [-1027791.3839038879], 
# Mean squared error: [80176587956.5067], Coefficient of determination: [45%]. Prediction: [201314.72836959]. 
# Therefore, the prediction value of house prices in King County using 2D Linear Regression Model is 201314.72836959 with 45% accuracy.
